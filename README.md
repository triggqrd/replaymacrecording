ReplayMac is a macOS menu bar instant-replay clipper.

It continuously buffers recent screen/audio capture and saves the last N seconds to an MP4 when triggered. Recording and save state stay visible in the menu bar so you always know what the app is doing.

## Features

- **Instant replay** — Continuously buffers the last N seconds (15–300) of your screen and audio. Save retroactively with a click or hotkey.
- **Dual display support** — Capture one or two monitors, saved as a side-by-side composite or as separate files.
- **Hardware-accelerated encoding** — HEVC or H.264 via VideoToolbox, with configurable resolution, frame rate (30/60/120 fps), and bitrate (10–50 Mbps).
- **System audio + microphone** — Separate AAC tracks with independent volume controls; choose your mic input device in Settings.
- **Ring buffer memory management** — Configurable total memory cap (256 MB–4 GB) shared across all replay buffers, evicting oldest footage as needed and trimming under system memory pressure.
- **Four configurable hotkeys** — Save clip, toggle recording, save last 15s, save last 60s — assign any key combination.
- **Clip library** — Browse, preview, play, reveal in Finder, or delete saved clips from a built-in library window.
- **Quality presets** — Performance, Quality, Ultra, and Custom modes that tune resolution, frame rate, and bitrate together.
- **Live settings** — Capture, encoding, and audio changes apply automatically while recording; no restart required.
- **Reliable save flow** — Preflight checks prevent saving when not recording or while the buffer is still filling; success feedback only appears after the clip is written.
- **Clear menu bar status** — Live badge shows recording state, buffered time, and save progress (Saving / Saved / Failed). Menu includes Start/Stop Recording, buffer usage, and save actions that disable until footage is ready.
- **Audio cue & notifications** — Optional sound and notification when a clip saves successfully; operational notifications for save failures and when recording stops or fails to start (permissions, display disconnect, GPU pressure).
- **Launch at login & auto-start** — Optionally begin recording automatically on login.
