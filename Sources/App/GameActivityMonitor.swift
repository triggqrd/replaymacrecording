/// Detection combines two signals:
///  - Apple's App Store "Games" category, read from each app's Info.plist. This
///    needs no setup and covers most native and App Store games.
///  - A user-managed list of bundle identifiers, for titles (many Steam games)
///    that do not declare that category. This path reads only the bundle id
///    delivered by the workspace notification, so it also works when file
///    access to other app bundles is unavailable.
///
/// "Playing" is treated as: a game is launched, is already running when watching
/// begins, or is brought to the front. Recording continues across brief app
/// switches (alt-tab) and only the *last* game quitting reports a stop, so a
/// short detour to another window never interrupts a clip buffer.
