# Changelog

## 1.6.5

- Add Retina capture resolution for HiDPI displays while keeping the macOS UI at its current scaled size
- Clarify logical, Retina, and custom output sizes in video settings, including dual-display output details
- Fix Swift concurrency warnings in GIF export

## 1.6

- Add "Open Last Clip" and "Reveal Last Clip in Finder" menu bar items, shown after the first successful save of the session and hidden if the clip is later moved or deleted
- Add "Open" and "Reveal in Finder" action buttons to the clip-saved notification banner
- Add a configurable hotkey to open the clip library
- Cache and parallelize clip library thumbnail loading to eliminate reload lag in large libraries
- Add multi-select batch actions to the clip library: favorite/unfavorite, share, add tags to all selected clips, and bulk delete with a confirmation that names the count and warns when favorites are included
- Warn before saving when the disk is nearly full, estimating clip size from the configured bitrate and blocking the save when free space falls below the estimate plus a 200 MB margin; fails open if capacity cannot be determined
- Add GIF export from the clip library (whole clip, Medium size by default) and from the trim view (selected range, with Small/Medium/Large size options); exports are written next to the source clip and revealed in Finder
- Add customizable clip file-name templates with {app}, {date}, and {time} tokens, configurable in Settings > General with a live preview, a token legend, and a reset action; the default template preserves the existing naming behavior
- Fix high-pitched system audio in merged clips

## 1.5

- Merge system and microphone audio by default so shared clips keep mic audio on services that ignore secondary audio tracks
- Add a setting to keep system and microphone audio as separate tracks inside the MP4 for editing workflows
- Resume recording after system wake when recording was active before sleep, with a default-on setting to control the behavior
- Clarify the README audio wording: ReplayMac exports MP4 clips and does not create separate `.aac` sidecar files

## 1.4

- Add native macOS share sheet actions to the clip library
- Add copy-file actions to the clip library with short visual confirmation
- Check GitHub Releases for newer versions on app launch
- Show an update link in the menu bar menu when a newer version is available
- Add release tag comparison tests
- Add GitHub Actions CI for Swift builds and tests
- Fix ScreenCaptureKit concurrency import and build on CI
- Roll back partially started dual-display streams when either stream fails to start
- Apply the same dual-display rollback during GPU-pressure stream recreation
- Notify the user and restart capture when live settings reconfiguration fails
- Add a configurable hotkey for saving the extended replay buffer
- Include the extended replay shortcut in configured save hotkey detection
- Add live system audio and microphone level meters to audio settings
- Measure post-volume PCM levels with lightweight RMS sampling and decay
- Reset displayed audio levels when capture or microphone recording stops

## 1.3

- Fix separate dual-display save preflight so saves succeed when both display ring buffers are ready but the primary buffer is empty in separate-file mode
- Add clip organization: favorites, display names, tags, notes, search, and safe file renaming in the clip library
- Add storage visibility and cleanup tools to show total library usage and move non-favorite clips to Trash by age or in bulk
- Add capture profiles in Settings to save, apply, update, and delete named video/audio/buffer configurations
- Add renaming for capture profiles
- Fix a capture-handler MainActor crash during pipeline updates
- Improve capture pipeline backpressure and dual-display concurrency: dedicated secondary-display queue, compositing outside the compositor lock, microphone conversion off the realtime tap path, and a bounded long-buffer append pump with drop tracking in monitoring output
- Update README feature notes and refresh app screenshots

## 1.2

- Add selected-app system audio capture with a clearer System audio mode picker: Off, All apps, or Selected app only
- Refresh the selected-app audio picker while Settings is open when apps launch or quit
- Avoid surprising audio fallback: selected-app mode captures no system audio for the session if the selected app is unavailable
- Add quick trim/export controls to the clip library, using passthrough MP4 export when available
- Add an opt-in extended replay buffer with 5, 10, and 30 minute durations
- Show explicit disk usage and SSD write warnings before enabling the extended replay buffer
- Add a menu action for saving the extended replay window
- Open Settings on the General tab by default whenever the settings window is opened
- Update README feature notes for per-app audio, quick trim, and extended replay
- Add an explanatory note for SCK queue depth in Advanced settings

## 1.1

- Fix buffer duration not being applied to ring buffers
- Update README
- Update AI attribution doc
- Apply capture, encoding, and audio settings while recording without restarting
- Skip unused dual-display pipelines and reduce high-resolution capture overhead
- Improve bitrate slider commit behavior and preset recommendations
- Show honest save status on the menu bar badge and notify on capture/save failures
- Wire mic device selection and memory cap into the live pipeline
- Remove non-functional watermark toggle from settings
- Update README
- Remove Sparkle auto-update integration
- Remove unused watermark code
- Refresh README and screenshots
