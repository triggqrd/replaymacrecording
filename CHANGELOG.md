# Changelog

## 1.4

## 1.3

- Fix separate dual-display save preflight so saves succeed when both display ring buffers are ready but the primary buffer is empty in separate-file mode
- Add clip organization: favorites, display names, tags, notes, search, and safe file renaming in the clip library
- Add storage visibility and cleanup tools to show total library usage and move non-favorite clips to Trash by age or in bulk
- Add capture profiles in Settings to save, apply, update, and delete named video/audio/buffer configurations
- Add renaming for capture profiles
- Fix a capture-handler MainActor crash during pipeline updates
- Improve capture pipeline backpressure and dual-display concurrency: dedicated secondary-display queue, compositing outside the compositor lock, microphone conversion off the realtime tap path, and a bounded long-buffer append pump with drop tracking in monitoring output

## 1.2

- Add selected-app system audio capture with a clearer System audio mode picker: Off, All apps, or Selected app only
- Refresh the selected-app audio picker while Settings is open when apps launch or quit
