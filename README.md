# ReplayMac

ReplayMac is a macOS menu bar instant-replay clipper.

It continuously buffers recent screen/audio capture and saves the last N seconds to an MP4 when triggered. Recording and save state stay visible in the menu bar so you always know what the app is doing.

## Features

- **Instant replay** — Continuously buffers the last N seconds (15–300) of your screen and audio. Save retroactively with a click or hotkey.
- **Dual display support** — Capture one or two monitors, saved as a side-by-side composite or as separate files.
- **Hardware-accelerated encoding** — HEVC or H.264 via VideoToolbox, with configurable resolution, frame rate (30/60/120 fps), and bitrate (10–50 Mbps).
- **System audio modes + microphone** — Record all system audio, no system audio, or only one selected app; microphone is saved as a separate AAC track with its own device and volume controls.
- **Live audio level meters** — Real-time system audio and microphone level meters in audio settings, with RMS-based measurement and auto-reset when capture stops.
- **Ring buffer memory management** — Configurable total memory cap (256 MB–4 GB) shared across all replay buffers, evicting oldest footage as needed and trimming under system memory pressure.
- **Opt-in extended replay buffer** — Save longer 5, 10, or 30 minute replay windows by rolling temporary segments to disk, with clear SSD write and disk usage warnings before enabling.
- **Five configurable hotkeys** — Save clip, toggle recording, save last 15s, save last 60s, save extended replay — assign any key combination.
- **Clip library + quick trim** — Browse, preview, trim/export, play, reveal in Finder, rename, or delete saved clips from a built-in library window.
- **Clip sharing** — Open the macOS share sheet or copy a saved clip file for pasting into another app.
- **Clip organization** — Search clips, mark favorites, add display names, tags, and notes, and filter the library down to favorites.
- **Storage cleanup** — See total library size and move non-favorite clips to Trash by age or in bulk.
- **Capture profiles** — Save named video/audio/buffer configurations and apply them later when switching games, displays, or workflows.
- **Quality presets** — Performance, Quality, Ultra, and Custom modes that tune resolution, frame rate, and bitrate together.
- **Live settings** — Capture, encoding, and audio changes apply automatically while recording; no restart required.
- **Reliable save flow** — Preflight checks prevent saving when not recording or while the buffer is still filling; success feedback only appears after the clip is written.
- **Clear menu bar status** — Live badge shows recording state, buffered time, and save progress (Saving / Saved / Failed). Menu includes Start/Stop Recording, buffer usage, and save actions that disable until footage is ready.
- **Audio cue & notifications** — Optional sound and notification when a clip saves successfully; operational notifications for save failures and when recording stops or fails to start (permissions, display disconnect, GPU pressure).
- **Launch at login & auto-start** — Optionally begin recording automatically on login.
- **Update availability check** — Check GitHub Releases on launch and show a download link in the menu when a newer version is available.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+
- Swift 6

## Download

Grab the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/picccassso/ReplayMac/releases) page. Updates are manual — download new releases from GitHub when you want to upgrade.

> **Note:** ReplayMac is not notarized. On first launch, right-click the app and choose **Open** to bypass Gatekeeper.

## Build from source

```bash
./build-app.sh
```

This compiles the app and outputs `dist/ReplayMac.app`.

## Output directory

Saved clips are written to:

`~/Movies/ReplayMac/`

When the extended replay buffer is enabled, ReplayMac also writes temporary rolling segments to a hidden `.ReplayMacLongBuffer` folder inside the output directory. Those segments are rotated automatically and removed when extended replay is disabled or recording stops.

Clip library notes, tags, display names, and favorite state are stored in a hidden `.ReplayMacClipLibrary.json` file inside the output directory.
